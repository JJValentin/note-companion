In the PARA method, subfolder specificity should balance clarity and flexibility. Here are a few guiding principles for deciding how specific to make your subfolders:

1. Stay Broad, Avoid Over-Nesting
Guideline: Start with broad categories and avoid creating too many layers within subfolders.
Example: Instead of Resource - Marketing > Templates > Social Media, consider just Resource - Marketing Templates.
Reasoning: Overly specific subfolders can make it harder to find things quickly and lead to clutter. Each subfolder should house enough items to be useful without becoming sparse.
2. Use One Level of Specificity Beyond PARA
Guideline: Aim for just one level of specificity beyond the main PARA categories.
Example: Project - Q1 Product Launch instead of creating multiple layers like Project > Marketing > Campaigns > Q1 Product Launch.
Reasoning: This approach gives enough context without overcomplicating your structure.
3. Consider Project and Area Context
Guideline: Make project names specific enough to know what’s inside, but not overly detailed.
Example: Project - Client Proposal XYZ instead of Project - Proposal for XYZ Corp, Marketing Strategy.
Reasoning: The aim is to identify the folder’s content at a glance, avoiding lengthy, detailed names that could slow navigation.
4. Group Similar Resources
Guideline: Group resources with similar functions or topics.
Example: Resource - Design Assets for a variety of visual resources instead of separate folders for logos, icons, and images unless you handle a large volume of each type.
Reasoning: Grouping resources keeps your structure simple while maintaining easy access to related items.
5. Use Archives for Specific, Finished Projects
Guideline: Be as specific as needed within the Archive subfolders to keep completed or inactive projects easy to find.
Example: Archive - 2023 Product Launch, Archive - Q2 Marketing Campaign.
Reasoning: The Archive is for reference, so specificity here is useful for finding completed work without it cluttering active folders.

always determine or create a subfolder folder x/folder y/file. 
never return resources, areas, projects, or archive folders.
never go more than one subfolder deep. ex: resources/animal Facts/Squirrel. very important!
